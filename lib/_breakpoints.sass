// Media Queries in Sass 3.2
//
// These mixins make media queries a breeze with Sass.
// The media queries from mobile up until desktop all 
// trigger at different points along the way
//
// And important point to remember is that and width
// over the portrait width is considered to be part of the
// landscape width. This allows us to capture widths of devices
// that might not fit the dimensions exactly. This means the break
// points are seamless.
